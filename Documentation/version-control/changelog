## Code optimization ##

- Comments for all the methods and classes in the modul state

*.state.scenario.Agent:
- Handle constructor chaining correctly:
	1. Copy constructor of agent has used constructor chaining to initialize other's attributes, though the
	constructor which has been used just initializes a new Agent with initial properties. It now copies the properties.
	2. Adjustments for using the setter and getter methods instead of the variables directly

*.state.scenario.Car:
- Use derived methods, instead of reinventing existing methods, by calling super methods if necessary.
	1. Deleted unnecessary methods which are available through the super class already
	2. Refactored constructor chaining to a correct behaviour as already done in the Agent class
	3. Typeconversion is now used for the use of car only methods

*.simulator.control.SourceController:
- Modified createDynamicElement to be able to spawn Horses
	1. Switch case now includes HORSE, which will call the DynamicElementFactory to create a new Element Horse
	2. Modified ScenarioElement to offer setter for type, which is necessary for the source controller to create other scenario elements than pedestrian

gui.topographycreator.model.TopographyElementFactory:
- Method createScenarioShape modified to support creating a Horse

simulator.projects.io.JsonConverter:
- Modified deserializeScenarioRunManagerFromNode to check whether the SCENARIO_KEY is deprecated and then try to remigrate it

simulator.models.ovm.OptimalVelocityModel:
- Derived from OVM to offer other classes like the horse class the option to act like a car

## Bug tracking and fixes ##

- Pounced on the problem of null attribute for pedestrians. Hence the Topography Designer is not working and results in a NullPointerException
	1. The NullPointerException occurs in scenario.Agent.getShape(Agent.java:170) because of null referenced attribute of pedestrian
	2. Trying to find out where the pedestrian is initialized with his attributes to figure out why the optimization of the agent class failed
	3. Probably the reason of the Exception is the bad adaption of the constructors or methods with type conversion
	4. The Scenario elements can be created in the createScenarioShape method in the designer. The IDrawPanelModel is called hereby to get the selected scenario element type.
	5. The Pedestrian class is created with the designer in the AgentWrapper which is called from TopographyElementFactory in the package gui.topographycreator.model
	=> Fixed the null attribute somehow by deleting the pedestrian from the json topography and inserting him back again

## Added Files ##

New files:
- Included the OptimalVelocityModel and OVMEquations file from Felix, which will be used for simulations for pedestrians and horses
